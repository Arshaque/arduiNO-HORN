# arduiNO-HORN

Abstract:     
	ArduiNO HORN --system includes IR sensors, Servo motor, arduiNO boards, and a joystick module. Using an IR sensor, it sends the message in the form of IR signals whenever the driver intends, to the intended vehicle. This could be altered by the joystick mounted on the steering, so as to define the target vehicle. This signals are further received and decoded to alert the driver of the targeted vehicle. This message is displayed on the dashboard, and also has the flexibility of voice assist. 
	
Description:     
	Nowadays using a traditional horn is increasing noise pollution and may unnecessarily disturb crowd. So here we have the arduiNO horn which is a horn without any noise. We use the IR sensors of our car to trigger the IR sensors of the car in front to notify them about our presence and using the joystick we can notify which way we wish to go and the driver in front will move accordingly. This prevents unnecessary disturbance to the other drivers on the road and conveys the signal to the only one vehicle preventing confusion. This way traffic jams can be prevented. This concept majorly works at traffic signals and local roads. The device will be comparable to the size of a smartphone and can be fit anywhere in the car. But the IR signals need to be available so it will out headed, maybe behind the number plate.
